		<!-- Redirect URI instructions -->
		<p>
			For your login success file to work, point your redirectUri parameter to the location of your login_success.html file, and include the full protocol and path to this file.  For example your redirectUri setting should look something like:
		</p>
		<pre>redirectUri: &quot;http://mysite.com/login_success.html&quot;</pre>
		<p>
			Be sure your callback uri matches the originating domain. If your website user visits www.mysite.com/somepage.html, be sure your redirect uri includes www. If your website user is coming from mysite.com/somepage.html, be sure the redirect uri does not include www.
